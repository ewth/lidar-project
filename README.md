# lidar-project
Engineering project around creating a LiDAR mapping system on ESP32 microcontrollers.

## Control Systems Engineering Project
This project was created for a third-year engineering project at Murdoch University, for the degree Industrial Computer Systems and Instrumentation and Control Engineering.

## Technology
The project was powered by two ESP32 microcontrollers, with their software written in C++. Processing for the resulting imaging was written in C#, although this remains unfinished.
